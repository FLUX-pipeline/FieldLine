# FLUX Pipeline

The **FLUX pipeline** is an open-source resource developed to support standardization in **Optically Pumped Magnetometer (OPM) MEG analysis**, particularly for applications in cognitive neuroscience. 

## Background on OPMs
OPMs can detect extremely weak magnetic fields, reaching **femtotesla sensitivity**, without the need for cryogenic cooling (Shah and Wakai, 2013). This breakthrough has paved the way for new MEG systems that are both flexible and highly sensitive (Boto et al., 2016a, Boto et al., 2016b). MEG provides **millisecond-scale insights** into human neuronal activity and enables **source localization**, making it a powerful tool for studying brain dynamics.

## Purpose and Features of FLUX
FLUX addresses key challenges in the field by offering a **structured and reproducible approach** to MEG analysis. With a focus on **quantifying and localizing oscillatory brain activity**, FLUX also supports **event-related fields** and **multivariate pattern analysis**. Built with **MNE-Python**, the pipeline includes **Jupyter Notebooks** that detail each step of analysis, with explanations, justifications, and visualizations. This documentation not only guides users through the technical processes but also provides recommended parameter settings, aiming to improve reproducibility and support pre-registration in research.

## Educational and Standardization Goals
The FLUX pipeline is also intended as an **educational resource**, making it suitable for both **self-study** and **guided workshops**. By aligning analysis practices across different toolboxes, FLUX helps **standardize basic steps in OPM-MEG analysis**, benefiting both new and experienced researchers. 

## Ongoing Development
The pipeline continues to evolve, adapting to advances in toolboxes and new discoveries in the field.
